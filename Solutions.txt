Scenario 1: EVSE Charging Station Downtime

Background: A high-traffic public EVSE station has suddenly gone offline.
Customers are unable to charge their vehicles, and there are several complaints on
social media. The system indicates a "communication error" with the station.
Question:

● How would you go about diagnosing the problem remotely?

I would start by seeing if anything stands out while doing some connectivity tests:
- Pinging the station
- Pinging other stations at the same site (To verify if single point issue or site issue)
- Have a look at backend systems and check OCPP logs for any errors.

Besides that I would gather local logs of the station if possible and check for hardware and software logs (Possible overheating, firmware issues, network issues)


● What steps would you take first to resolve the issue?

- Try and restart the station to see whether connectivity issue is resolved.
- Reset cached network settings and re-configure to try and re-establish network connection.
- If cellular of WiFi check the SIM status, APN settings and signal/channel strength and interference.
- If Zigbee enabled, make sure WiFi is not in same channel range as Zigbee to avoid interference.

If none of this helps, ask someone onsite to physically inspect the charger and take photos to send to me. Ask them to reconnect any possible disconnected wires and have a look at possible blown fuses.

● How would you prioritize addressing this issue while handling other ongoing support tickets or tasks?

Since this is a high impact issue and there are complaints on social media I would mark the ticket as High priority and start troubleshooting and applying possible quick fixes immediately.

If my own case load is already high I will ask help of colleagues to take over some of my existing tickets and help me get on top of the high priority one.


● When would you escalate the issue, and to whom?

If the issue can not be resolved by support within the first hour, I would say it has be escalated to engineering and get the account manager for the client involved as well to manage further expectations.

For an escalation it´s important to document all that has been tried already and to include all relevant logs from before to failure up until the moment of escalation.

1. Escalate to Network/IT Team: If the issue is related to backend connectivity.
2. Escalate to Field Technicians: If physical intervention is needed (hardware replacement, power cycle, cable reconnection).
3. Escalate to Manufacturer: If the station has a firmware/software bug requiring further investigation.
4. Inform Management: If the issue persists for an extended period, leading to severe customer impact.
